# :star: Nicla Vision Drivers :star:
Plug-and-play MicroPython drivers for Arduino Nicla Vision sensors.

![Alt Text](assets/Nicla_ROSpkg_Architecture.png)

-------------------

## Description

This package contains the MicroPython drivers enabling the [Arduino Nicla Vision](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nicla-vision/) board to be ready-to-use in the ROS world! :boom:

The implemented architecture is described in the above image: the Arduino Nicla Vision board streams the sensors data to a ROS-running machine through TCP/UDP socket. This package provides the drivers that will be running on the Nicla Vision board, allowing to:
- connect the board to a WiFi
- start a TCP/UDP socket stream
- sense all the sensors 
- serialize the sensors data
- send the sensors data through the socket 

Here a list of the available sensors onboard the Arduino Nicla Vision board:
- **2MP color camera** 
- **Time-of-Flight (distance) sensor**  
- **Microphone**  
- **Imu**

In this repository you can find the MicroPython code optimised for establishing a connection, sensing and transmitting the sensors data by the board.

# Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to get the drivers running onboard the Arduino Nicla Vision:

1. Connect the board to the pc
2. If it is your first time with the board, please follow the [Getting Started tutorial here](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nicla-vision/getting-started/), for getting the latest available firmware of the board through OpenMV IDE
3. `$ git clone https://github.com/ADVRHumanoids/nicla_vision_drivers.git`
4. `$ cd nicla_vision_drivers`
5. Copy the `main.py` and `config.json` files in Ã¬nside the memory of the board.
6. Reboot the board (unplug and plug again the board to the pc)

# Usage 
Follow the following two steps for enjoying your Arduino Nicla Vision board.

1. Turn on an hotspot connection on your pc
   ** Note: ** if you are on Ubuntu, click on Settings->WiFi->top three dots->"Turn on WiFi Hotspot...". If "Turn on WiFi Hotspot..." is grayed out, click first on the Network tab and then follow       again the procedure starting from the WiFi tab. If the Hotspot is already configured, run this command in a terminal: `$ nmcli connection up Hotspot`
2. `$`ifconfig` on your pc, copy the ip address under the enp voice (following point)
3. Set the other parameters in the `config.json` file:
   - `ssid`: the name of the activated Hotspot
   - `password`: the password of the activated Hotspot
   - `ip`: ip address copied at point 2.
   - `connection_type`: "tcp" or "udp" (the user can choose if the board should transmit the sensors data by UDP or TCP socket connection)
   - `verbose`: true or false (for visualizing some debug prints in OpenMV IDE) 
4. Running the `main.py`:
  - just turn on the board (e.g. connecting it to the pc)
  - using OpenMV IDE [Getting Started tutorial here](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nicla-vision/getting-started/)
